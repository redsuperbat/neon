# Neon

Small expression based language written in rust ðŸ¦€

The language has a nice small set of features:

- Higher order functions
- Addition and subtraction
- If statements
- Recursion

Feel free to try it out in the [playground](https://redsuperbat.github.io/neon/)

Everything is made from scratch, the neon_core library has no dependencies and the syntax highlighting is custom made by intepreting the tokens and adding decorations to the monaco editor.
