fn ignite(): string {
  "âš¡ Neon is alive"  // Function returns a string automatically, no explicit return required.
}

/**

 * Next, we'll assign that value to a variable.
 */

// Let's demonstrate control flow with an `if` expression:

let response = if signal == "âš¡ Neon is alive" {
  "ðŸ’¬ Status: ONLINE"  // Positive case: Status set to ONLINE.
} else {
  "Status: OFFLINE ðŸš¨"  // Negative case: Status set to OFFLINE.
}

/**
 * In Neon, `if` statements return a value, making them usable 
 * within expressions, loops, or assignments.

/**
 * Neon also supports structs. Below, we define a struct with properties:
 */

struct CyberEntity {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  location: string,
  upgrades: string[],
  status: () -> string
}

/**
 * Instantiating the struct like so:
 */

  name: "Cybernaut X",
  age: 2049,  // Define attributes of the object.
  location: "Neo Tokyo, Sector 7",
  upgrades: ["ðŸ¦¾ Bionic Arm", "ðŸ§  Neural Link"],
  status: ignite
}


/**
 * Finally, we will return the avatar's status as the script's final output.
 */

cyber_entity.status()  // Evaluates to a string indicating the system's status.

/**
 * Expected output:
 * "ðŸ’¡ Cybernaut X is fully operational."
 *
 * Neon is built with Rust at its foundation, seamlessly integrated with WebAssembly 
 * for efficient execution in the browser. The entire systemâ€”from the lexer, parser, 
 * to the interpreterâ€”is custom-built for a smooth and streamlined developer experience.
 *
 * Explore Neon's features further by experimenting with more examples and code variations. 
 * Thank you for exploring Neon!
