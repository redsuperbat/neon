/**
 * Welcome to Neon!
 *
 * Neon brings simplicity, speed, and efficiency to programming. This quick introduction 
 * will guide you through some of Neon's core features and functionality.
 *
 * First, let's begin with a basic "Hello, World!" program in Neon:
 */

print("💡 Neon Awakens")  // Output a simple message to the console.

/// Now, let's declare a function using Neon's concise syntax.

fn ignite(): string {
  "⚡ Neon is alive"  // Function returns a string automatically, no explicit return required.
}

/**
 * The function `ignite` returns a string value. 
 * Next, we'll assign that value to a variable.
 */

let signal = ignite()  // Store the result of `ignite` in a variable.

/// Let's demonstrate control flow with an `if` expression:

let response = if signal == "⚡ Neon is alive" {
  "💬 Status: ONLINE"  // Positive case: Status set to ONLINE.
} else {
  "Status: OFFLINE 🚨"  // Negative case: Status set to OFFLINE.
}

/**
 * In Neon, `if` statements return a value, making them usable 
 * within expressions, loops, or assignments.
 */

let final_signal = ignite() + " | " + response  // Concatenate multiple string values.

/**
 * Next, we'll use a `for` loop to iterate over an array of values.
 */

for pulse in ["🔋1", "🔋2", "🔋3"] {
  print("Pulse level:", pulse)  // Print each value from the array.
}

/**
 * Neon also supports objects. Below, we create an object with properties and methods:
 */

let cyber_entity = {
  name: "Cybernaut X",
  age: 2049,  // Define attributes of the object.
  ignite,  // Use shorthand to reference an existing function.
  location: "Neo Tokyo, Sector 7",
  upgrades: ["🦾 Bionic Arm", "🧠 Neural Link"],
  status: fn check_status(): string {
    "💡: is fully operational."  // Define a method that returns a string.
  }
}

/// Accessing object properties is straightforward in Neon:

print("Entity's status:", cyber_entity.status())  // Call the object's method to check status.

/**
 * Finally, we will return the avatar's status as the script's final output.
 */

cyber_entity.status()  // Evaluates to a string indicating the system's status.

/**
 * Expected output:
 * "💡 Cybernaut X is fully operational."
 *
 * Neon is built with Rust at its foundation, seamlessly integrated with WebAssembly 
 * for efficient execution in the browser. The entire system—from the lexer, parser, 
 * to the interpreter—is custom-built for a smooth and streamlined developer experience.
 *
 * Explore Neon's features further by experimenting with more examples and code variations. 
 * Thank you for exploring Neon!
